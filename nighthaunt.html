        <h1>The Nighthaunt Army</h1>
        <p>A Nighthaunt is an immaterial form of Undead called a gheist or wraith. It is the spiritual remains of a
             once-living mortal that has become afflicted by a magical curse that leaves it so twisted by the pain,
             bitterness or regret they suffered in life that they now seek only to spread this darkness to others.
